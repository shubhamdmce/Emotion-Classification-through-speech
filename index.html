                                    <p>Speech is one of the most fundamental and natural means of communication in human beings. The emotion recognition is natural for humans but it is more difficult task for machine. Therefore the purpose of emotion recognition system is to improve machine and human communication using knowledge related emotion in such a way that human machine interface becomes more efficient. Recognizing emotion from speech has become one the active research themes in speech processing and in applications based on human-computer interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Sound signal is one of the main medium of communication and it can be processed to recognize the speaker emotion.The basic principle behind emotion recognition lies with analysing the acoustic difference that occurs when uttering the same thing under different emotional situations. Besides facial expressions or gestures, speech has proven as one of the most promising modalities for the automatic emotion recognition&nbsp;</p><p>Features extracted consist of Centroid, Spectral Spread, Entropy, Spectral Energy ,Zero Crossing, Pitch, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) and Linear Prediction Cepstrum Coefficients (LPCC).It is observed that various emotional sounds collected from a particular speaker give better results in classification of emotion than when collected from many speakers.&nbsp;</p>

We use statistics relating to the pitch, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Formants of speech and other inputs to classification algorithms. The emotion recognition accuracy of these experiments allow us to explain which features carry the most emotional information and why. &nbsp;</p>

Initially Dataset is processed by removal of silence and noise using end point detection. Frames from the processed data are used to extract features such as Centroid, Spectral Spread, Entropy, Spectral energy and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients.These extracted features are used to train classifiers  </p>

                                    		<li><h2><b>ZERO CROSSING RATE&nbsp;</b></h2><p> The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to negative or back. It is a key feature to classify percussive sounds. Since high frequencies imply high zero crossing rates, and low frequencies imply low zero-crossing rates, there is a strong correlation between zero-crossing rate and energy distribution with frequency. </p>
                                        	<img src="Pictures/zerocrossing.png"/></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>PITCH&nbsp;</b></h2><p> The pitch is the distinctive quality of a sound, dependent primarily on the frequency of the sound waves produced by its source, which can be computed by the pitch detection algorithm (PDA). High Pitch often refers to high frequency oscillated signals and low pitch refers to low frequency oscillated ones.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>CEPSTRUM&nbsp;</b></h2><p>A cepstrum is the result of taking the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the logarithm of the estimated spectrum of a signal.</p>
                                        	<img src="Pictures/cepstrum.png"/></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>ENTROPY&nbsp;</b></h2><p> Weiner Entropy measure of Spectral flatness or tonality coefficient is used to characterise audio spectrum. Spectral flatness provides a way to quantify how noise-like a sound is, as opposed to being tone-like.To extract entropy feature speech is first pre-emphasized using a pre-emphasis filter in order to spectrally flatten the signal, and then the pre-emphasized speech is separated into short segments called frames. This will significantly enhance the ability to identify the emotional aspects of speech. In order to reduce the familiar edge effects, Hamming window is applied to each frame.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>SPECTRAL CENTROID&nbsp;</b></h2><p>The spectral centroid is used to characterise a spectrum. It indicates where the "center of mass" (around what frequency most of the spectrum is presnt). Perceptually, it has a robust connection with the impression of "brightness" of a sound.This feature is similar to formant frequencies and provides complementary information to cepstral features and also robust to noise. In short this would give us an idea to what frequency range most of the power of the spectrum would lie in. </p>

                                        	<li><h2><b>SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION&nbsp;</b></h2><p>Spectral energy distribution is a plot of brightness or flux density versus frequency or wavelength of light.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>SPECTRAL SPREAD&nbsp;</b></h2><p> Spectral Spread is a measure of absolute deviation from spectral centroid.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>SPECTRAL SKEWNESS&nbsp;</b></h2><p> The skewness of a spectrum is the ratio of third central moment of spectrum and the 1.5 power of the second central moment.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>LINEAR PREDICTION CEPSTRUM COEFFICIENTS&nbsp;</b></h2><p>LPCC embodies the characteristics of particular channel of speech, and the same person with different emotional speech will have different channel characteristics, so we can extract these feature coefficients to identify the emotions contained in speech. The computational method of LPCC is usually a recurrence of computing the linear prediction coefficients (LPC), which is according to the all-pole model.</p></li>
                                        	<li><h2><b>MEL FREQUENCY CEPSTRAL COEFFICIENTS&nbsp;</b></h2><p>The first step in any automatic speech recognition system is to extract features. Speech is the sound that is produced by human that are filtered by the shape of the vocal tract including tongue, teeth etc. This shape determine what sound comes out. The shape of the vocal tract manifests itself in the envelope of the short time power spectrum, and the job of MFCC is to accurately represent this envelope.</p></li>

                                        <h2><b>Explanation&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                        <p>An audio signal is constantly changing, so to simply things we assume that on short time scales the audio signal doesn’t change much. We frame the signal into 20-40ms frames. If the frames is much shorter we don’t have enough samples to get a reliable spectral estimate, if it is longer the signal changes too much throughout the frame.</p><p>After that we calculate the power spectrum of each frame. Periodogram estimate identify which frequencies are present in the frame. Periodogram spectral estimate still contains a lot of information not required for Speech recognition. For this reason, we take clumps of periodogram bins and sum them up to get an idea of how much energy exists in various frequency regions. This is performed by our Mel filterbank. Mel Scale tells us exactly how to space our filterbanks and how wide to make them.</p><p>Once we have the filterbank energies, we take the logarithm of them. The final step is to compute the DCT of the log filterbank energies. There are two main reasons this is performed. Beacuse our filterbank are all overlapping, the filterbank energies are quite correlated with each other. The DCT de-correlates the energies which means diagonal co-variance matrices can be used to model the features in a classifier. But only 12 of the 26 DCT coefficients are kept.</p>

                                    <h2><b>OXFORD VOCAL (OxVoc) SOUND DATABASE DESCRIPTION&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>The database consists of natural affective vocal sounds from human adults (male and female). This database contain 49 non-verbal sounds expressing a range of happy, sad and neutral emotional states. The major advantage of this database are the inclusion of vocalizations from naturalistic situations, which represent genuine expressions of emotion. Out of 49 data-point in the database, 19 stimuli are of Adult cry and 30 of Adult laugh. The average frequency of the adult cry stimuli is 368.22 Hz, and that of adult laugh is 348.83 Hz </p>

                                    <h2><b>DISCUSSION&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>After a brief literature review, it was found that emotions were classified in 2 distinct ways, by either classifying them individually or by plotting them on a scale of arousal and excitation. We approached the task from the first approach due to low number of classes we had to classify while keeping the philosophy of the second approach in extracting features.</p>
                                    <h2><b>Features Comparison&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>2D and 3D plot are shown for better understanding and visualization of features. 2D plots contains one features on x-axis and other on y-axis. The two emotion are plotted on the same graph to see the correlation between them.</p>
                                    <img src="Pictures/Scatterplot.png" height="100%" width="110%" />
                                    <p>In the we have plotted spread and MFCC 3 features. We can see that laugh is majorly contained in two areas only while cry is much more distributed. This gives us a very low value of correlation coefficient.</p>
                                    <p>Considering the redundancy in feature extraction, a correlation matrix is designed which is shown below,</p>
                                    <img src="Pictures/comp.png" height="100%" width="100%"/>
                                    <p>Highly correlated features are colored with dark red, while highly uncorrelated features are colored with black color. Green are the intermediate ones. We can see that features with itself gives a correlation of 1(diagonal left to right).</p>

                                    <h2><b>Classification&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>The features that we extracted and after a brief analysis, found to have some differentiating factor were, spectral spread, spectral centroid, spectral energy, spectral entropy and the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. The first few coefficients of MFCC have said to give information on the timbre of the voice, which we correspond to the arousal aspect while features such as spectral spread, centroid and entropy provide information on the FFT spectrum itself.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The two classes we had to classify are: Laugh and Cry from male and female natural sounds from whose sound clips 40ms frames were extracted.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Two main classifiers were adopted to run the classification task, a Support Vector Machine with a Radial Basis Function kernel and then later on a Neural network ( Multi Layer Perceptron)</p>
                                   
                                    <p>Running on a training set of 5000 frames we have the following training results:</p>

                                	 <h2><b>SUMMARY&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>Emotion detection of speech is done by feature extraction by processing the discrete time domain signal and using various digital techniques.The extracted features are used to train Ml classifier which gave a training efficiency 85% and test efficiency of 81%. It has been observed that data collected from a single person for various emotion are efficient in training the classifier. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Features that are used are more of frequency domain such as Spectral flux ,Spectral Spread etc., are efficient to process the signal.Oxford Dataset is used which contains adult laugh and cry emotions.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2><b>FUTURE EXTENSIONS&nbsp;</b></h2>
                                    <p>At present the code is used to distinguish two emotions. This can be extended to multi emotion detection. We can also include NLP Sentimental Analysis.This can be extended for indian vocal Dataset and further used in activities. The trained data set would give better results for locals.</p>
